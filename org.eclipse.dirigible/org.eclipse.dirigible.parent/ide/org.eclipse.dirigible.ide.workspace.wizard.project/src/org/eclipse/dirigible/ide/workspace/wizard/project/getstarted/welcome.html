<h3>Welcome to Dirigible!</h3>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You have managed to reach one of the most advanced Cloud Development Toolkits on this planet!</p>
<p>It seems you do not have any project in your Workspace, hence probably the best option is 
to lean back and to follow this wizard. It will provide you with the necessary information about 
the key must-to-know features. </p>
<p>This wizard will create a 'Get Started' project, which will contain the main artifacts needed to run an end-to-end application service.</p>
It includes:<br>
<ul>
    <li>a database table to persist the data;</li>
	<li>a RESTfull JavaScript server-side service for CRUD operations;</li>
	<li>and user interface in HTML5 for manipulating the data via a browser</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>More advanced techniques such as creation of mock data files, flows and jobs, wiki pages, extensions, tests 
as well as the life-cycle management capabilities of discovery, import and export, cloning of instances, 
monitoring and access management and more, can be found at:
