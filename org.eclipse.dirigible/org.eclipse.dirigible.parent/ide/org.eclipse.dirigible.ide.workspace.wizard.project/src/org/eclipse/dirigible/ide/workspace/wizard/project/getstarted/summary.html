<p>Great! You are at the finish of the process of creating of your first project with Dirigible!</p>
<p>You learned how to start with the RAD techniques by utilizing the capabilities for
modeling data structures and creating underlying database artifacts, writing RESTful services in JavaScript and generating pattern-based HTML5 user interfaces.</p>
<p>There is only one more important concept that you have to get familiar with and you can go.
It is Activation and Publishing processes. You can find more info about them at 
<a target='_blank' href='http://www.dirigible.io/help/activation.html'>http://www.dirigible.io/help/activation.html</a> and
<a target='_blank' href='http://www.dirigible.io/help/publishing.html'>http://www.dirigible.io/help/publishing.html</a>.
In short to be able to see your changes immediately in the Preview window (Sandbox space) you have to either enable 
"Auto-Activate" option under Project menu (enabled by default) or 
click on Activate action every time you want the executed code to get updated.
